# HopeShot ðŸŒŸ

**A positive news web app experiment**

## What is HopeShot?

HopeShot collects articles from multiple free news APIs and creates a unified feed focusing on constructive and hopeful stories. Using AI-powered sentiment analysis, we evaluate and curate the most uplifting news to help people stay informed while maintaining a positive outlook.

## Goals

* Collect articles from multiple free news APIs
* Unify them into a single feed of constructive stories  
* Run AI-powered sentiment analysis for deeper evaluation
* Store analyzed results in Google Sheets for prototyping and review
* Iterate to display the best positive news content
* Add more features as we learn and grow

## Why This Project?

This is a **learning-first project** with an intentionally simple and modular codebase. It serves as a foundation for experimenting with:
- Next.js for the frontend
- FastAPI for the backend  
- AI integration for sentiment analysis
- Data pipelines and storage

## Status

ðŸš§ **In Development** - Starting fresh with proper documentation and step-by-step development
