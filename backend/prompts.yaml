  active: true
  description: "Strict JSON schema compliance with clear examples"
  prompt: |
    OBJECTIVE:
    Analyze news for real-world progress and hope, not just financial or business success.
    Positive sentiment must reflect stories that inspire optimism for humanity (e.g., medical breakthroughs, education access, environmental recovery, social equality).
    Avoid treating stock market gains or corporate expansions as positive unless they directly improve people’s lives.

    REQUIRED OUTPUT:
    Return ONLY a JSON array with exactly {article_count} objects. No extra text.

    {{
      "article_index": integer,
      "sentiment": "positive" | "negative" | "neutral",
      "confidence_score": float (0-1),
      "emotions": {{
        "hope": float (0-1),
        "awe": float (0-1),
        "gratitude": float (0-1),

      "geographical_impact_location": ["Example: USA", "Canada", "Europe", "Asia", "Africa", "Global"],
      "overall_hopefulness": float (0-1),
      "reasoning": "Explain top emotion + source credibility in max 15 words"
    }}

    - Reasoning MUST cover: strongest emotion + source credibility (e.g., “High hope, credible medical journal”).
    - Categories: use only provided themes or close variants.
    - Geography: never smaller than a country.
    - Output must be valid JSON with no extra text.
