# HopeShot Architecture

## Project Overview
HopeShot is designed as a learning-first project with simple, modular components that are easy to understand and extend.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js (React framework)
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python web framework)  
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI API for sentiment analysis
- **Data Storage**: Google Sheets (for prototyping)
- **Version Control**: Git + GitHub

└── scripts/                  # Utility scripts

## Development Approach
1. **Documentation First** - Always document before coding
2. **Small Steps** - One feature at a time with testing
3. **Modular Design** - Each component has a single responsibility
4. **Learning Focus** - Code is optimized for understanding, not just performance

## Next Steps
- [ ] Set up frontend structure (Next.js)
- [ ] Set up backend structure (FastAPI)
- [ ] Create first API endpoint
- [ ] Test the connection between frontend and backend
